## RBniCSx - reduced order modelling in FEniCSx ##

**RBniCSx** contains an implementation in **FEniCSx** of several reduced order modelling techniques for parametrized problems. **RBniCSx** is still at a very early development stage compared to legacy **RBniCS**, and many features are presently missing.

**RBniCSx** is currently developed and maintained at [Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://www.unicatt.it/) by [Prof. Francesco Ballarin](https://www.francescoballarin.it).

Like all core **FEniCSx** components, **RBniCSx** is freely available under the GNU LGPL, version 3.
